841,"In justification of its conclusion that the instrument sued on was the final and complete integration of the understanding of the parties, the court in the Cargill case invoked the doctrine, often repeated, that the test of completeness of a written contract is the document itself: if the document appears to be complete", that ends the inquiry and parol evidence is inadmissible to prove first the fact, and then the purport," of the alleged omission.""[8] The court conceded", however," that incompleteness need not ""appear on the face of the document from mere inspection"" and added a significant qualification: ""it is enough that the omission appear when the court", aided if necessary, and only if necessary, by extrinsic evidence," comes to apply the contract to the designated subject matter.""[9].""","In support of its conclusion that the document sued on was the final and complete version of the understanding of the parties, the court in the Cargill case used the principle, often repeated, that the test of completeness of a written contract is the document itself: if the document 'appears to be complete, that ends the inquiry and oral evidence is not allowed to prove first the fact, and then the meaning, of the claimed omission.' The court admitted, however, that incompleteness need not 'appear on the face of the document from mere inspection' and added an important qualification: 'it is enough that the omission appear when the court, helped if necessary, and only if necessary, by outside evidence, comes to apply the contract to the specified subject matter.'"

844,"Application of the rule in any particular case clearly requires, therefore, a preliminary judgment concerning the parties' intentions with regard to the writing itself: did they mean it to be an exclusive source of contractual liability or something less than this, a partial statement of the terms of their agreement requiring supplementation from other sources? To determine what the writing means, or meant, to the parties, it must be viewed against the background of their attitudes and expectations, and while the writing serves an important evidentiary function in the reconstruction of this background, it cannot provide its own interpretive framework (any more than a literary text can criticize itself).","Use of the rule in any particular case clearly requires, therefore, a preliminary judgment concerning the parties' intentions with regard to the writing itself: did they mean it to be an exclusive source of contractual responsibility or something less than this, a partial statement of the terms of their agreement requiring addition from other sources?

847,"Where it seems obvious from an inspection of the writing that the parties did in fact assent to it as an integrated statement of their agreement, it may seem like a metaphysical quibble to insist that a writing can only have greater or lesser evidentiary weight and can never be self- validating.","Where it seems obvious from an examination of the writing that the parties did in fact agree to it as an integrated statement of their agreement, it may seem like a philosophical minor point to insist that a writing can only have greater or lesser evidentiary weight and can never be self-validating."
